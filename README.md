oDesk API Tips/Comments
---------------------

-- Listing objects through the API (jobs, offers, etc) don't provide total to implement pagination.
It only provides total of requested <u>offset;count</u>. Thus only fragmented / partial data loading is possible.

-- Online job posting accept budget of 5 usd minimum (for fixed price jobs), while through the API less budget can be accepted?!
